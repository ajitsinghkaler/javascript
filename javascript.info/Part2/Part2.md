# Javascript Fundaments

## Intro

If src is set, the `<script>` content is ignored.

## Code Structure

JavaScript does not assume a semicolon before square brackets `[...]`.

## Use Strict

- "use strict" can be put at the beginning of the function body instead of the whole script. Doing that enables strict mode in that function only. But usually, people use it for the whole script.
- Please make sure that "use strict" is at the top of your scripts, otherwise strict mode may not be enabled.
- Only comments may appear above "use strict".
